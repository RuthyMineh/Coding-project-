        <p>Many of the stores and businesses I buy makeup from are: Sephora, Mac, NYX, Maybelline, Lancome, Covergirl, NARS, Dior, Chanel, Estee Lauder, and many more. Makeup is something very important for various girls. However, many hink women put makeup for others, to impress others. But really, women put on makeup for theirselves! To make themselves happy!! Any women can put makeup just for fun, or if they have an event, or are just leaving the house. Makeup, put to the right amount, is something that can make all women feel beatiful. </p>
